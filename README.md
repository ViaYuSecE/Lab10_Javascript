# Task 1

API
- Application Programming Interface
- They allow different software systems to communicate.
- They are important because they are the bridge between the server and the user, allowing the user to request/send data to the server.
- I think it's like a salad bar! The staff slice and prepare all the ingredients before the store opens, and we as customers can just choose which ingredients (endpoints) to get and then combine them to make our own salad.

# Task 2

GET
- Retrieves data from the server
- A student tries to see the list of all courses and sections available for enrollment.

POST
- Sends data to create a new resource on the server
- A student creates a schedule plan with all the required courses.

PUT
- Updates an existing resource on the server
- A professor who was scheduled to teach several courses is replaced by a different professor with different free times, so the courses are updated.

DELETE
- Removes a resource from the server
- A student deletes their schedule plan.

# Task 5

Fetch API
- Pros: Modern, cleaner and more concise syntax, better error handling
- Cons: Less detailed control

XMLHttpRequest
- Pros: More detailed control, better browser compatibility for older systems
- Cons: Older, more verbose

XMLHttpRequest may be ideal for older browsers because it's more compatible, but for most cases Fetch API is recommended.
